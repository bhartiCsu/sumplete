Embark on a journey where logical realms intertwine with celestial wonders, guiding us through the captivating landscape of AI-driven puzzle-solving.

# Sumplete: The Game and Its Origin

## Sumplete Overview

Sumplete is a logic-based number game where players fill a grid based on row and column sums while adhering to specific constraints. The game was introduced through the Sumplete website([https://sumplete.com/](https://sumplete.com/)), offering various puzzles of different sizes and difficulties. As an AI invention, Sumplete showcases the creativity of AI models like ChatGPT in designing engaging games.

## Creation and Concept

While technically, ChatGPT doesn't invent anything as a stochastic parrot, it demonstrates the capability of AI to generate novel concepts and rule sets. Sumplete combines elements of puzzle-solving and constraint satisfaction problems, making it an interesting challenge for AI enthusiasts and players alike.

# Sumplete Rules

Sumplete follows a simple set of rules, combining elements of Sudoku and Kakuro:

1. **Grid:** The game is played on a square grid, divided into cells.
2. **Numbers:** Players use numbers (1 to N, where N is the grid size) to fill the cells.
3. **Constraints:** Each row and column has associated sum constraints.
4. **Objective:** The goal is to fill the grid in a way that satisfies the row and column sum constraints.
5. **Elimination:** Numbers can be eliminated from cells based on constraint violations.
6. **Winning:** A valid solution is achieved when all constraints are satisfied.

Understanding these rules is crucial for formulating Sumplete as a constraint satisfaction problem and applying solving algorithms. The combination of logical deduction and backtracking makes Sumplete an intriguing challenge for both AI and human players.

### Getting Started
## Variables, Domains and Constraints

# 3 X 3 Puzzle

| G1 | G2 | G3 | S1 |
|----|----|----|----|
| G4 | G5 | G6 | S2 |
| G7 | G8 | G9 | S3 |

| S4 | S5 | S6 |
|----|----|----|

Let G1-G9 represents grid position and S1-S3 are targeted row sum and S4-S6 are targeted column sum.

# Variables
 {G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, G6, G7, G8, G9}

# Domain for 3 X 3
G1: {V1,0}  
G2: {V2,0}  
G3: {V3,0}  
G4: {V4,0}  
G5: {V5,0}  
G6: {V6,0}  
G7: {V7,0}  
G8: {V8,0}  
G9: {V9,0}

Where V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, V9 are the original values in the grid.

# Constraints

### Unary
- Each grid can either have 0 or V where V is the original value in the grid.
### Binary

1. G1 + G2 + G3 = S1
2. G1 + G4 + G7 = S4
3. G4 + G5 + G6 = S2
4. G2 + G5 + G8 = S5
5. G7 + G8 + G9 = S3
6. G3 + G6 + G9 = S6

## How to Run

# Running the Sumplete Solver

To run the Sumplete Solver, follow these steps:

1. **Download and Extract the Tar Folder:**
    - Download the tar folder 'sumplete.tar' containing the Sumplete solver.
    - Extract the contents of the tar folder to a directory of your choice.
    - cd your-tar-folder

2. Run the python script
    - open terminal here
    - python backtrackAc3.py

3. Provide Input:
    - Enter the grid size when prompted (e.g., 3X3, 4X4, 5X5, 6X6, 7X7, 8X8, or 9X9).
    - Input values for each grid in the specified format (e.g., G1, G2, ..., G9).
    - Input target row sums (S1 to S3).
    - Input target column sums (S4 to S6).
4. View Output: 

After providing input, the program will display the entered values and the output, including variable assignments, domains, constraints, and whether a solution was found.

**Example Output:**
