# Sumplete: The Game and Its Origin

## Sumplete Overview

Sumplete is a logic-based number game where players fill a grid based on row and column sums while adhering to specific constraints. The game was introduced through the Sumplete website([https://sumplete.com/](https://sumplete.com/)), offering various puzzles of different sizes and difficulties. As an AI invention, Sumplete showcases the creativity of AI models like ChatGPT in designing engaging games.

## Creation and Concept

While technically, ChatGPT doesn't invent anything as a stochastic parrot, it demonstrates the capability of AI to generate novel concepts and rule sets. Sumplete combines elements of puzzle-solving and constraint satisfaction problems, making it an interesting challenge for AI enthusiasts and players alike.

# Sumplete Rules

Sumplete follows a simple set of rules, combining elements of Sudoku and Kakuro:

1. **Grid:** The game is played on a square grid, divided into cells.
2. **Numbers:** Players use numbers (1 to N, where N is the grid size) to fill the cells.
3. **Constraints:** Each row and column has associated sum constraints.
4. **Objective:** The goal is to fill the grid in a way that satisfies the row and column sum constraints.
5. **Elimination:** Numbers can be eliminated from cells based on constraint violations.
6. **Winning:** A valid solution is achieved when all constraints are satisfied.

Understanding these rules is crucial for formulating Sumplete as a constraint satisfaction problem and applying solving algorithms. The combination of logical deduction and backtracking makes Sumplete an intriguing challenge for both AI and human players.
